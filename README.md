# 100 programming challenges


In this section I'm collecting simple programs that I write while learning Core Java. This page includes challenges on various Java topics such as control statements, loops, classes & objects, functions, arrays, alghoritms etc.


My goal is to face as many problems as possible, before trying to create larger applications.

1. [ArrayList implementation](https://gist.github.com/wsadrak/bc376ccf4171e731563450a1ff437d5e) - my own implementation of ArrayList class. It contains add(), get(), remove(), size() methods and use dynamic array logic - it increases its size when it reaches threshold.

2. [Multiplication table](https://gist.github.com/wsadrak/536b9a5a80fa57867a877376dae28779) - program to create a simple, text-based, multiplication table based on user's input.

3. [Prime numbers checker](https://gist.github.com/wsadrak/f319c28d49c6d3ea539e9a13be5e9f5b) - program to check the given number is a prime number or not.

4. [First 100 prime numbers](https://gist.github.com/wsadrak/838a4c3bb031a563df629972efc0c518) - program to find the sum of the first 1000 prime numbers.

5. [Prime numbers from 1 to n](https://gist.github.com/wsadrak/fefd6e4dc9346c3fcecb203ff206476a) - program to display prime numbers from 1 to n (entered by user).

6. [Factorial using recursion](https://gist.github.com/wsadrak/60ab895c5a5f3d20ce8387241c44dc56) - program to calculate factorial of a given number using recursion

7. [Leap year](https://gist.github.com/wsadrak/29a53f5b1050330d77983f1e304aa62c) - program to check whether the input year is a leap year or not

8. [Floyd's triangle](https://gist.github.com/wsadrak/0034614685009b7145024e91d4d8c592) - program to print the Floydâ€™s triangle based on user's input (number of rows)

9. [Duplicate characters in string](https://gist.github.com/wsadrak/94c257e521c8812c6c20880be30456bd) - program to find out duplicate or repeated characters in a string, and calculate the count of repeatation.

10. [Perfect number](https://gist.github.com/wsadrak/d5738d7e473f309c02244bf78ff35ac1) -  program to find perfect number or not.

11. [Fibonacci sequence](https://gist.github.com/wsadrak/f688456a4689c65bd25b6b4d67119a58) - a program to print fibonacci series.

12. [Bubble Sort](https://gist.github.com/wsadrak/b6df6af0f3321ee844398c7105429595) - program to sort array elements using Bubble Sort. 

13. [Common integers between two arrays](https://gist.github.com/wsadrak/00df41043e7002d0c189a7662d8bdc4c) - simple program to find common integers between two sorted arrays.

14. [Middle index in array](https://gist.github.com/wsadrak/f17b1dd2ddf1f2164fa5f761644b7d89) - program to find out the array index or position, where sum of numbers preceeding the index is equals to sum of numbers succeeding the index.

15. [Top Ten repeated words from file](https://gist.github.com/wsadrak/d1f55f8d2bef05a6426e2c93a9df81d2) - program to read words from a file, count the repeated or duplicated words, sort it by maximum repeated or duplicated word count and limit to 10.

16. [Reverse String using recursion](https://gist.github.com/wsadrak/a7eedb156c354b82bb94fda8ac541114) - program to reverse string using recursion

17. [Palindrome using recursion](https://gist.github.com/wsadrak/ab50846f72aa0c66be9aee248454fa79) - program to check whether String is palindrome using recursion

18. [Reverse array](https://gist.github.com/wsadrak/5a14f1ffaa9b193012467525afc5fcfc) - program to program reverse the array. For example if user enters the array elements as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 then the program would reverse the array and the elements of array would be 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 

19. [Reverse words in String](https://gist.github.com/wsadrak/a792c298392a3ef6252d4ac87229b106) - program to reverse every word of a string and display the reversed string as an output.

20. [Factorial using loops](https://gist.github.com/wsadrak/700b8285bb753e787da8bde8f794fc38) - program tof ind Factorial using For and While loop

21. [Sort array](https://gist.github.com/wsadrak/35efae6fe73d4c43b012cc6dd7607faa) - program to sort an array in ascending and descending order

22. [Armstrong number](https://gist.github.com/wsadrak/3d652567da57f036d8e3ddae17cbd46c) - my implementation of code to print all Armstrong numbers for given range
